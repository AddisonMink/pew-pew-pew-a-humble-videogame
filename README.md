INTRODUCTION<br />
This is something I made in GameMaker a couple of years ago. It's a space shooter in the vein of Gradius. PewPewPew2.gmx.zip is the project file that contains all the source code and assets. PewPewPew2.zip contains an Windows installer for thegame.

INSTRUCTIONS
- Press the arrow keys to move
- Press the 'x' key to fire a bullet. You can hold up to 5 bullets at a time, as shown on the 'Ammo' counter in the HUD. You have unlimited bullets, but they regenerate slower than you can shoot them.
- Press the 'z' key to fire a missile. Missiles are larger and slower than bullets, but they do much more damage and have a larger area of effect. You start with 3, and some enemies will drop missile refills.
- Your armor is displayed on the HUD. You die when you have 0 armor. You start with 3, and some enemies will drop armor refills.
